    <h2>Bonds</h2>
    <p>Bonds are an advance payment made by the tenant at the start of a lease. They cover damages to the property or any outstanding invoices or rent arrears when the lease ends. Bonds are usually equal to four weeks' rent.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Who holds bonds?</h3>
    <p>Bonds are held by Bonds Administration, not a real estate agent. This is a state government body and falls under the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety.</p>
    
    <h3>What's considered to be damage at the end of a lease?</h3>
    <p>The owner is entitled to use the bond to pay for any damages at the end of the lease. They have to prove that you're at fault for the damage and must have invoices to fix it. The owner can't claim what's called 'fair wear and tear'. This is things like minor chips to walls, worn-down carpets &#40;doesn't count if you have a wheeled office chair&#41;, and small scratches on benchtops. It doesn't include things such as broken blinds or torn flyscreens.</p>
    
    <h3>What's a pet bond?</h3>
    <p>A pet bond is an additional &#0036;260 on top of the security bond. According to the Residential Tenancies Act WA 1987, the pet bond is intended to pay for fumigation of the property after you vacate. Always ask if the agent is going to schedule fumigation when you leave, because it's not always needed.</p>
     
    <h3>Why you might get asked to pay two weeks' rent with the bond at the start of tenancy</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you can be asked to pay an extra two weeks' rent on top of the bond amount. This is not part of the bond and it isn't credit that you can get back at the end of your lease. This just covers the first two weeks that you are in the property and your next rent payment is due a fortnight after you move in.</p>

<article id="secondcontent">
    <h2>Rent</h2>
    <p>Generally, you can pay rent weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Please take note that paying monthly is not the same as paying every four weeks. This mistake happens more often that you'd think.</p>
   

    <h3>How to calcuate monthly rent</h3>
    <p> 
    There are 12 months in the year but there are 52 weeks. <br>
    12 x 4 = 48 weeks, while 13 x 4 = 52 weeks. <br>
    To work out what your monthly rent is going to be, multiply your weekly rent by 52 and then divide the result by 12. <br>
    Using the example of weekly rent being &#0036;350: <br>
        350 x 52 = 18,000<br>
        18,000 &#247; 12 = 1516.67 <br>
        So your rent would be &#0036;1516.67 per month
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why you should always try to pay your rent &#40;and what you should do if you can't&#41;</h3>
    <p>Always try to pay your rent, because you can receive a breach and a termination notice for non-payment. If you're unable to pay rent, such as being out of work or sick, contact the agent/owner and explain the situation to them. This can allow them to create a payment plan so you don't become overwhelmed by arrears.</p>
    
    <h3>What are rent increases and how often can you get one?</h3>
    <p>Currently, legislation states that you can only receive two rent increase notices per year, and they can't be within six months of each other. There are new rules coming into effect in July that limits rent increases to once per year.<br>
    There are two clauses in the lease that cover rent increases: one in Part A and one in Part C.
