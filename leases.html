    <h2>All About Leases</h2>
    <p>Leases are a contract made between an owner and a tenant in regards to renting a property. They can be complex documents, so the information collected below is aimed at answering common questions people need to know.</p>
    
    <!-- It was my intention to have an image at the top of each page. However, once I implemented the banner image, I found that having a second image crowded the pages too much, so I left them out. -->
    
    <h3>The different types of leases</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Fixed Leases</strong></dt>
            <dd>These leases have a defined start and end date and are usually either 6 or 12 months long, though they can be used for other periods of time. Generally, fixed leases are considered more secure for both tenants and owners.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Periodic Leases</strong></dt>
            <dd>These leases have no specific end date and the lease will continue indefinitely with the same contract details as it started with.</dd>
        </dl>
    
    <h3>What do you need to do at the start and end of a tenancy</h3>
    <h4>Once Approved as a Tenant:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Set up an electricity account at the new house &#40;UNLESS an agent tells you that electricity will           be charged through them&#41; </li>
    <li>Set up a gas account for hot water. You will be able to pick which company you want </li>
    <li>Set up an internet account for a fixed modem, otherwise you’ll be using mobile data</li>
    <li>Get renter’s insurance. It usually costs around $180 yearly &#40;and can be paid monthly&#41; and             covers things like break-ins, damage you cause, etc. &#40;Note: this is optional but strongly           recommended&#41; </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Once You Receive the Keys:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Immediately go check if the hot water system is turned on and working. If it isn’t, let the             owner/agent know immediately so it can be fixed. If you’re not sure where it is, ring and ask.</li>
     <li>Check that all the keys you got from the owner/agent fit all the locks and work.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What is a property condition report?</h3>
    <p>A PCR is a large document that literally details the condition of the property before a tenant moves     in. It will list any wear and tear or damage that the property already has. WA legislation requires     a tenant to receive a PCR to look over and comment on within one week of moving in. <br>
        When you get one, read it and make sure that you agree with what’s in it. You can write comments noting any damage that you think has been missed. Once you’ve read it, sign it and send it back to the owner or agency, otherwise it is presumed that you agree with the default PCR given to you. You can either make a copy of the version you added comments to or ask for a copy to be sent back after it’s been looked at. <br>
        A PCR is important for both the owner and tenant. For you, it means that if someone tries to charge you for repairs at the end of your lease for something that was already damaged, you can refute the claim. </p>
    
    <h3>What are routine inspections?</h3>
    <p>Routine inspections have a few important rules to know:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>They can only occur a maximum of four times a year</li>
    <li>They must be at a reasonable time for the tenant and inspector &#40;usually between 9am and 5pm&#41; and the notice will specify whether the inspection will be before or after noon. You can request a change of time if the proposed one doesn’t work for you &#40;i.e. due to appointments, religious holidays, etc.&#41; </li>
    <li>The tenant must get between 7 to 14 days’ notice of the inspection. You'll receive an entry notice form, usually either by post or email. This form can be found on the <a href=forms.html>Forms &amp; Resources page</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h3>What's a break lease?</h3>
    <p>This is when you end a lease before the agreed end date in the contract. Most agents have a break lease clause that can be found in Part C of the standard lease document, while private landlords may not have it. <br>
    If this clause isn't present, a break lease is by agreement and you as the tenant are responsible for continuing to pay rent until the day before a new tenant enters the home, as required by the Residental Tenancies Act WA. <br>
    If the clause is in your lease, you can bear the cost of advertising for the property &#40;which can be up to approximately &#36;200&#41;, paying the rent up until the new tenant moves in, the cost of the final inspection fee &#40;about &#36;180&#41;, and what's called an unexpired portion of the letting fee paid by the owner to the agent. This last part can sometimes be charged if you break a lease in the first year of the contract. The agent can explain more about it if you need to know.<br>
    The most important thing about a break lease is that you should try your best to let the agent/landlord hold home opens while you're vacating. This will shorten the amount of rent you will have to pay as it increases the chance of a new tenant being found faster. Sometimes they can even move in the day after you leave. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What happens to your lease when the owner sells the property?</h3>
    <p>If you have a fixed term lease, your lease goes with the property. The new owner has to honour your lease and can't ask you to leave until the end date.<br>
    If you have a periodic lease, as soon as the sale goes through, you will receive 30 days' notice to vacate. <br>
    If the owner defaults on their mortgage and the bank takes possession of the house, you will also be given 30 days' notice to vacate. This occurs regardless of the lease type, but can only occur in this specific situation.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Giving notice to vacate</h3>
    <p>If you have a fixed lease, you have to give a minimum of 30 days' notice in writing if you want to vacate at the end of your lease. <br>
    If you're on a periodic lease, you only have to give 21 days' notice, also in writing.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What are final/bond inspections?</h3>
    <p>An agency will do an inspection after you vacate the property to assess damage, wear and tear, and cleaning. If there’s any damage that if new to the property, your bond is used to cover the costs. The bond also covers any cleaning costs that may be requested by the agency. You can pay for your own cleaner; just provide a copy of the cleaning invoice to the agency for their records as well.<br>
    This does not apply to existing wear and tear. Anything that is considered existing wear and tear will be noted in the PCR. 
 </p>
    
    <h3>Sub-letting</h3>
    <p>This is when a tenant rents out a room or part of a house they have a lease for to another person.</p>
    <h4>What are your rights when sub-letting?</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If the person you're leasing the room from asks for a bond, they are obligated to tell you where the bond is going to be kept and you have to agree for it to be kept there.</li>
    <li>The amount of rent you as the sub-letter will pay needs to be agreed on before you move in.</li>
    <li>Do your own version of PCR for the area you're renting, and take photos of literally everything. Try to be able to reconstruct the room with the photos. Be as in-depth as you can.</li>
    <li>For vacate notices, you as the sub-letter have the same rights as a person on a periodic lease, and need to receive and give 21 days' notice in writing. However, your lease will end when the lease for the house ends too. You can't have an end date that's past the tenant's who's leasing the whole house.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Leasing and Strata</h3>
    <p>If you live in an apartment complex, there are extra rules that apply. This is called a strata, and the additional rules will be included usually at the back of the lease agreement but can generally be summarised as not being rude to your neighbours and being considerate of others. </p>
